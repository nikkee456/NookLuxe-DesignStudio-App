            <h2>Our Process:</h2>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
                This is the first step towards project initiation. An owner’s visioning meeting is conducted to understand the scope and requirement of the project. Post the visioning exercise, Look and Feel, Style, Spatial Planning, Schematic Design, Detail Design Development, and 3D Visualization stages are completed.
            </p>
            <h3>Build</h3>
            <p>
                In this phase, the interior designers create BOQs and good-for-construction drawings for the contractor to quote. Nook & Look then negotiates all contracts on behalf of the clients. Through efficient project management systems, we ensure timely delivery with the best industry quality practices.
            </p>
            <h3>Contractor</h3>
            <p>
                During execution, the contractor takes complete responsibility for all project aspects. Nook & Look supervises all contractors and vendors as a project management consultant for efficient project supervision.
            </p>
            <p>
                All in all, design-build services at Nook & Look will not only save your time but also optimize cost overruns. We understand each complication which can arise in a project and schedule activities accordingly to mitigate any kinds of risks.
